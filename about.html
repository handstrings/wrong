            <h1>About Wrong</h1>
            <h2>The App</h2>
            <p>
                Let me make something clear:
                I hate writing. It took an hour to write that sentence: an hour
                of sitting, standing, pacing, thinking, not-thinking, blinking,
                &amp;c.. Do you know what doesn't take an hour for me to do?
                Writing a line of code. So I built Wrong to help me focus while I
                write.
                <br>
                <small>
                    (N.B.: I'm not writing this in Wrong at the moment since I'm
                    trying to format the HTML as I go. I don't know how long it would
                    have taken me to write that sentence in Wrong, but I would
                    have more focused doing it at least. I'll draft the
                    rest of this section in the app. Let's see how it goes.)
                </small>
            </p>
            <p>
                The one person that I know well enough to call a true friend once
                asked me, &ldquo;<em>sorry, man, I didn't want to know why you were
                building another writing app, I just asked if anyone was
                using this chair or if I could take it over to my table?</em>&rdquo;
                And it's a good question. A really good question. You see, there's a
                considerable number of writing apps already on the market. Some
                even focus on distraction-free writing too. So why bother, as my
                friend once put it, &ldquo;building another writing app?&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I've used
                these other apps before and I really loved using them, or parts
                of them, but each one was missing something that the other had,
                or something that none had, and this was problematic given that
                I hate writing and would do anything to get out of doing more of
                it (including spending a few months, on-and-off, writing another
                writing app). Being able to fully customize a text editor is
                important for getting it out of the way and for getting in the
                mood. Imagine sprinting in a pair of sneakers that don't fit.
                So I decided to build a
                tool that I, or anyone else who knew how to or who even just
                wanted to but couldn't or who was looking for an excuse, any
                excuse, to stop writing until a specific feature was added,
                as in protest, but still had a way to communicate consistently
                with someone who did know how to, could easily modify.
                That tool happens to be Wrong. Want to see a new feature added
                to the app? Found a bug in the software? Whatever it is,
                <a href="//github.com/handstrings/wrong/issues">
                    create a new issue on Wrong's GitHub page</a>.
                I (or anyone else who cares as much about the app as we both do,
                you and I) will get to work on it ASAP. The good thing about Wrong
                is that anyone, whether he or she knows how to code or not, can
                modify how his or her app looks while using it, posthaste and
                with as few limitations over the controls as possible&mdash;which
                is really convenient for everyone. A minute in the theme
                customizer, and you're set. So there.
            </p>
            <h2>Using Wrong on the Web</h2>
            <p>
                Because this is an open-source JS/HTML/CSS project,
                you're free to use this app or any variation of this app on your
                own website (see
                <a href="//github.com/handstrings/wrong/blob/master/LICENSE.md">LICENSE.md</a>).
                That said, the web version of Wrong isn't mature yet.
                The web app isn't cross-browser since I only developed it with
                <a href="//github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit">node-webkit</a>
                in mind. There isn't even any documentation
                on how to use the Wrong app online.
                Parts of the code still need to be resolved.
                To wit, the software isn't ready for your web app, but it will be.
                I'll post relevant doc updates when they're made available.
            </p>
