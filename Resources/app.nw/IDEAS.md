+ make app's own filetype (.wreath?) => 
  make special no-delete modes? only crosses out or obfuscates text when 
  "delete" is pressed. Also allow for inline comments (/* */ style?) 
+ add focus mode? (e.g. document centers & focuses on current line while typing)
+ add no-delete mode (write non-stop then edit later)?
+ COSMOGENESIS: create a living, changing, colourful universe out of the user's
  text. only a few words/letters remain around the user's cursor. as she writes,
  the newly created letters float away into the distance and join the growing
  universe behind the text while (if there is text after the cursor) letters
  float in from the universe behind to create the words ahead.
+ Speech-based writing and editing (using modes?)?
+ Images in document?
+ Allow literals (" within quotes ") and regexp (/\s+/g) in Find & Replace?
+ Inline comments (just color styling)? Like i tend to do with [(comments)].
+ auto-complete while typing (words used in document only?)
