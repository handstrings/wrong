+ make changes to node-webkit allowing for 
  [this](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/367)?
  [lighttable's nw implements this](https://github.com/LightTable/node-webkit).
+ quiet backups =>
  (into ~/Library/Application Support/Wreathe/Backups/file(date).wreath)
+ allow users to upload own sounds (ambient only? e.g. can't upload click sounds
  from settings ui)
+ allow the app to check for updates on startup.
+ Settings save automatically unless "Reset" is PRESSED AND CONFIRMED.
  this app is about focus and writing, it's not about creating themes
  (can put more advanced theme creator on website). 
  Get out of your own way when designing things: it's not about you.
+ iCloud & file nav implementation (see that lua HN post or w/e)
  (if want into App Store).
+ add a favicon for app completeness (and so nothing unexpected happens).
+ Add "Select Next/Prev Tab" option to Window menu, not View menu.
+ Add some kind of satisfying visual echo on Save.
+ Drag to rearrange tabs?
+ Buttons in customizer don't turn blue on select anymore.
