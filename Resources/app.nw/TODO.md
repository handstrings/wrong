+ make changes to node-webkit allowing for 
  [this](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/367)?
+ make app's own filetype (.wreath?) => 
  make special no-delete modes? only crosses out or obfuscates text when 
  "delete" is pressed. Also allow for inline comments (/* */ style?)
+ quiet backups =>
  (into ~/Library/Application Support/Wreathe/Backups/file(date).wreath)
+ allow users to upload own sounds (ambient only? e.g. can't upload click sounds
  from settings ui)
+ allow the app to check for updates on startup.
+ add focus mode? (e.g. document centers & focuses on current line while typing)
+ COSMOGENESIS: create a living, changing, colourful universe out of the user's
  text. only a few words/letters remain around the user's cursor. as she writes,
  the newly created letters float away into the distance and join the growing
  universe behind the text while (if there is text after the cursor) letters
  float in from the universe behind to create the words ahead.
+ Settings save automatically unless the button "Reset" is pressed & confirmed. 
  this app is about focus and writing, it's not about creating themes
  (can put more advanced theme creator on website). 
  Get out of your own way when designing things: it's not about you.
+ Rewrite all external libs on your own (codemirror, spectrum or w/e).
+ Speech-based writing and editing (using modes?)?
+ create in-app menu where you can execute commands by text
  ("find jdjd", "define sdmsd", etc)
+ IMPORTANT: Remove frame, total flat ui, then ADD TABS INSTEAD OF WINDOWS ?? !!
