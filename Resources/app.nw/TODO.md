+ make changes to node-webkit allowing for 
  [this](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/367)?
  [lighttable's nw implements this](https://github.com/LightTable/node-webkit).
+ make app's own filetype (.wreath?) => 
  make special no-delete modes? only crosses out or obfuscates text when 
  "delete" is pressed. Also allow for inline comments (/* */ style?)
+ quiet backups =>
  (into ~/Library/Application Support/Wreathe/Backups/file(date).wreath)
+ allow users to upload own sounds (ambient only? e.g. can't upload click sounds
  from settings ui)
+ allow the app to check for updates on startup.
+ add focus mode? (e.g. document centers & focuses on current line while typing)
+ COSMOGENESIS: create a living, changing, colourful universe out of the user's
  text. only a few words/letters remain around the user's cursor. as she writes,
  the newly created letters float away into the distance and join the growing
  universe behind the text while (if there is text after the cursor) letters
  float in from the universe behind to create the words ahead.
+ Settings save automatically unless the button "Reset" is pressed & confirmed. 
  this app is about focus and writing, it's not about creating themes
  (can put more advanced theme creator on website). 
  Get out of your own way when designing things: it's not about you.
+ Speech-based writing and editing (using modes?)?
+ IMPORTANT: iCloud & file nav implementation (see that lua HN post or w/e).
+ add a favicon for app completeness (and so nothing unexpected happens).
+ "X" button for Control.
+ Elements in the theme editor should be clearly labeled. The mystery meat
  design may be slick, but it's mostly inconvenient. User doesn't want or
  need to play around with values just to find a specific thing.
+ Show tabs in fullscreen (as superfluous). Tab+border+text color should match
  that of tm text color.
+ "X" buttons for tabs.
+ "+" button at end of tab bar to add a tab.
+ Images in document?
+ Add "Select Next/Prev Tab" option to Window menu, not View menu.
+ Allow literals (" literally ") and regexp (/\s+/g) in Find & Replace?
