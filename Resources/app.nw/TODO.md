+ make app's own filetype (.wreath?) => 
  make special no-delete modes? only crosses out or obfuscates text when 
  "delete" is pressed. Also allow for inline comments (/* */ style?)
+ quiet backups =>
  (into ~/Library/Application Support/Wreathe/Backups/file(date).wreath)
+ allow users to upload own sounds (ambient only? e.g. can't upload click sounds
  from settings ui)
+ please make an icon.
+ allow the app to check for updates on startup.
+ add focus mode? (e.g. document centers & focuses on current line while typing)
+ COSMOGENESIS: create a living, changing, colourful universe out of the user's
  text. only a few words/letters remain around the user's cursor. as she writes,
  the newly created letters float away into the distance and join the growing
  universe behind the text while (if there is text after the cursor) letters
  float in from the universe behind to create the words ahead.
+ Redesign entire "Settings" user interface. 
  Click "settings" -> nice animation of triangular buttons sliding in from left.
  Get rid of entire translucid black background flat part and instead give each 
  button/element its own translucid black bg with white text/icon. 
  Triangular buttons arranged in down-up manner. \/\/\/\/\
  Also: No longer need to "save" or "create" themes. Settings save automatically
  unless the button "Reset" is pressed & confirmed. this app is about focus
  and writing, it's not about creating themes (put theme creator on website). 
  Get out of your own way when designing things; it's not about you.
