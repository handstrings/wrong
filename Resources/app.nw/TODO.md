+ make changes to node-webkit allowing for 
  [this](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/367)?
  [lighttable's nw implements this](https://github.com/LightTable/node-webkit).
+ quiet backups =>
  (into ~/Library/Application Support/Wreathe/Backups/file(date).wreath)
+ allow users to upload own sounds (ambient only? e.g. can't upload click sounds
  from settings ui)
+ allow the app to check for updates on startup.
+ Settings save automatically unless the button "Reset" is pressed & confirmed. 
  this app is about focus and writing, it's not about creating themes
  (can put more advanced theme creator on website). 
  Get out of your own way when designing things: it's not about you.
+ iCloud & file nav implementation (see that lua HN post or w/e)
  (if want into App Store).
+ add a favicon for app completeness (and so nothing unexpected happens).
+ Elements in the theme editor should be clearly labeled. The mystery meat
  design may be slick, but it's mostly inconvenient. User doesn't want or
  need to play around with values just to find a specific thing.
+ Show tabs in fullscreen (as superfluous). Tab+border+text color should match
  that of tm text color
  ("can be done easily" through css with border-color: inherit).
+ Add "Select Next/Prev Tab" option to Window menu, not View menu.
+ Add some kind of satisfying visual echo on Save.
+ Drag to rearrange tabs?
